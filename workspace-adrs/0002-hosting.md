# 2. Hosting Alpha Prototype

Date: 2024-07-16

## Status

Draft

## Context

Over the course of this project, we will require a prototype for user research. Participants will need to access the prototype over the internet. The prototype requires some backend compute so cannot be hosted as a static site. 

In an ideal world, we would host this on existing DCMS infrastructure, such as using Cloud Run in GCP. This is not an option.

## Options

### Supplier Prototyping AWS Account

### New Heroku Account

### Hire some server
