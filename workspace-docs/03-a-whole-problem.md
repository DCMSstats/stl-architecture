## Solving a whole problem

[Service standard point 2 is "Solve a whole problem for users"](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-2-solve-a-whole-problem). At this point in time, the best initial whole problem seems to be:

1. Capture the attention existing and new operators.
2. Operators register their short term lets. At this point they would verify H&S compliance.
3. Platforms display the registration number on a listing. Ideally they would also verify the registration.
4. Officers at Local Authority enforce registration.
5. Planners at Local Authority use data from the register to inform decisions.

Within this problem the technical questions seem to be:
- At step 3: What mechanism could we offer to verify a Short Term Let registration by the Booking Platforms? What do they already do for existing schemes? What else is available?
- At step 4: What access to the data would be required? What format should that be in? What are the security considerations? We know a similar scheme at MHCLG is creating a Local Authority view of a public register.
- At step 5: What data points are useful? What format should that be in?
