We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). And we recommend them via our [Architecture Principles](https://madetech.github.io/architecture-handbook/principles/communicate_into_the_future.html) See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)."},{"href":"../decisions/2/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":"Hosting Alpha Prototype","text":"Hosting Alpha Prototype Status Context Options Supplier Prototyping AWS Account New Heroku Account Decision Consequences Date: 2024-07-16 Accepted Over the course of this project, we will require a prototype for user research. Participants will need to access the prototype over the internet. The prototype requires some backend compute so cannot be hosted as a static site. In an ideal world, we would host this on existing DCMS infrastructure, such as using Cloud Run in GCP. This is not an option. The supplier uses one of their existing AWS accounts to host the prototype. This muddies the water on ownership of the prototype after the end of the project, but does have the benefit of existing controls on the account. We create a new Heroku account and team for the prototype, that exists for the duration of the project. The main drawback is that we create an IT asset owned by DCMS without many controls. We're going to use Heroku as this leaves the most control in the hands of DCMS and the risk level of this asset is very low. At the end of the alpha stage, DCMS will need to find a new hosting solution if they still with the prototype to be hosted."},{"href":"../decisions/3/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":" Register Adapter","text":"Register Adapter Status Context Options Register Adapter Component (separate deployable) Register Adapter Module (module as part of monlith) Recommendation Date: 2024-09-10 Proposed It feels very likely at some point that this component will be required, when more applications are trying to access the register. This ADR is only about whether this component is required immediately, when there is only a single monolithic application accessing it. Pros: Effectively just a lightweight version of the separate deployable, offering less of the benefits and less of the disadvantages. It requires a fair amount of discipline to complete this perfectly. It is an established pattern to take a module and extract it into a separate deployable. In this case, in order to get the service live as quickly as possible, the register adapter should probably start as a module (maybe following the [ports and adapters pattern](https://8thlight.com/insights/a-color-coded-guide-to-ports-and-adapters)) to benefit from the speed and simplicity while the service is new, and extract the component when it is necessary."},{"href":"../decisions/4/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":" Geographically identifying units","text":"Geographically identifying units Status Context Options Text description GPS coordinates Drawn Sections Recommendation Date: 2024-09-11 In Progress One of our riskiest assumptions in this alpha is \"We assume that we will be able to technically capture all types of STL (e.g. using unique geographic location)\". It is important for us to capture geographic location of short-term lets: Unlike other types of rental property in England, short-term lets do not match uniquely to UPRNs or addresses: It is also important that whatever method we choose can be used with an offline journey, and without JavaScript in the online journey. Short-term lets that occupy all of an address would not be required to supply more detail. Short-term lets that do not occupy all of an address but are the only short-term let on site would probably not be required to supply more detail. Options to be evaluated on: Operators provide a text description of whatever section of an address is part of the short-term let. Operators coordinates of the location of the short-term let. Could be Ordnance Survey Eastings and Northings. Operators draw the boundaries of the short-term let on a map. This could be provided digitally online with javascript. Offline or without Javascript, the user would probably have to mark the area on a physical map to be digitised by an administrator."},{"href":"../data-modelling-of-let-ownership-and-management/","type":"Workspace Documentation","title":"Data modelling of let ownership and management","text":"Data modelling of let ownership and management The ownership and management of Short Term Lets can be a little complicated.
